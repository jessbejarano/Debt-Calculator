# Financial Debt Calculator Flask Web Application

## Designed to optimize debt elimination and facilitate financial tracking.
Users input debt data, and the algorithm calculates and shows users see the month to month calculations, total interest paid, and final payoff date.


The debt method implemented in this application is a strategic approach to debt repayment that begins by prioritizing the settlement of debts 
with the lowest balance, regardless of interest rate. This method factors in other recurring payments and 
interest charges across all outstanding debts. As each debt is paid off, its minimum payment is then directed 
towards the next debt with the current lowest balance.
            
While this method may lead to higher overall interest payments compared to other methods which focus on paying the high interest debts first, 
it can provide a positive mindset towards becoming debt-free. Even a small increase in confidence can provide a 
motivational boost, helping individuals stay committed to their debt repayment goals and make necessary adjustments to their financial planning
to accelerate progress.
