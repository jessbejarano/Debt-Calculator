## This calculator implements the Snowball Method for paying off debts and credit cards

The Snowball Method is a strategic approach to debt repayment that begins by prioritizing the settlement of debts 
with the lowest balance, regardless of interest rate. This method factors in other recurring payments and 
interest charges across all outstanding debts. As each debt is paid off, its minimum payment is then directed 
towards the next debt with the current lowest balance.
            
While the Snowball Method may lead to higher overall interest payments compared to the Avalanche Method, 
it can provide a positive mindset towards becoming debt-free. Even a small increase in confidence can provide a 
motivational boost, helping individuals stay committed to their debt repayment goals and make necessary adjustments 
to accelerate progress.
