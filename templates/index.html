        <p>The Snowball Method is a strategic approach to debt repayment that begins by prioritizing the settlement of debts 
            with the lowest balance, regardless of interest rate. This method factors in other recurring payments and 
            interest charges across all outstanding debts. As each debt is paid off, its minimum payment is then directed 
            towards the next debt with the current lowest balance.</p>
        <p>While the Snowball Method may lead to higher overall interest payments compared to the Avalanche Method, 
            it can provide a positive mindset towards becoming debt-free. Even a small increase in confidence can provide a 
            motivational boost, helping individuals stay committed to their debt repayment goals and make necessary adjustments 
            to accelerate progress.</p>
